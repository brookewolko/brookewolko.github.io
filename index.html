    <h1>Hello world</h1>
    <p>My name is Brooke and I love my friends.</p>
    <p>My birthday is coming up soon! I can't believe I'm going to be 22.
        <p>My roommate Sara's birthday was yesterday and it was so much fun. We ate at Playa Bowls, her favorite, and won our team water polo game at night!</p>
        <p>We are having a birthday party with friends this weekend and I cannot wait! I started decorating last night (Wednesday) I was so excited.</p>
        <p>My birthday is after the party so we are doing a 'joint' party to celebrate both of us with all of our friends together.</p>
